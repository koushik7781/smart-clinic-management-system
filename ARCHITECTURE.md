# 1. Introduction & Goals

The **Smart Clinic Management System** is a full-stack web application designed to modernize outpatient clinic operations. The primary goal is to provide a seamless, secure, and efficient platform for administrators, doctors, and patients to manage appointments, medical records, and other clinical data.

# 2. Architectural Style

We will adopt a **Monolithic Architecture**.

* **Reasoning**: For a single developer and a project of this scope, a monolith is simpler to develop, test, and deploy.

# 3. Technology Stack

* **Frontend**: `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
* **Backend**: `Java 17+`, `Spring Boot 3.x`
* **Databases**:
    * `MySQL`: For structured, relational data.
    * `MongoDB`: For unstructured, flexible data.
* **Security**: `Spring Security`, `JSON Web Tokens (JWT)`.
* **Deployment**: `Docker`, `GitHub Actions` for CI.
* **Version Control**: `Git`, `GitHub`.
